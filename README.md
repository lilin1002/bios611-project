Hello, this is my BIOS 611 Data Science Project. In this git repository, you can find 4 folders: Data, Program, Document, and Figures. Data contains the original two datasets related to CO2 emissions, Program has the R scripts for the figures, Document has the final project report in pdf formats, and Figures has all the figures used in the final report. Also, you can find Dockerfile, README, makefile under the main branch. Dockerfile includes how to build R and R packages under docker. Makefile cleans all the figures and regenerates them. README has an introduction about this project. My project illustrates the trends in emissions
(1990â€“2014) using a decomposition analysis of the Kaya identity. The top 10 CO2 emitting countries with total CO2 emission, change in population and emissions from 2013 to 2014, and the 2014 per capita emissions, suggesting the need for diverse strategies to mitigate carbon emissions to meditate anthropogenic climate change.
